# PORTFOLIO

## About me

My name is **Rafal Baczynski-Sielaczek**. I'm master of sociology. After many years of working with people and for people I have chosen a new direction of professional development. My goal is to develop test and technical skills. On this site I would like to share my all gained experience from my personal studies & researches.
<br>
## My expierence
I have recently embarked on a career change journey in order to become a Software Tester. This career path has interested me for quite a while, so I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills. I believe that high quality is the bestselling point of services and products. Thanks to my diversified experience I have highly developed **interpersonal skills and empathy**, which help me see the bigger picture and function well within a team. My experience in Non Goverment Organisations has also equipped me with valuable tools, such as **open-mindedness and adaptability**. In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field.<br>
<br>
My previous professional experience is a professional path related to sociology. I conducted many classes and courses for students of sociology, both theoretical and practical. Most importantly for me, I carried out many research projects. This is the reason why I chose Software Testing. Social research has a methodology, precisely defined stages, tools and ends with a report. Just like testing!!!<br>
<br>
As a social researcher, I had to be **curious**, **systematic** and **precise**. And it is also worth mentioning one of the most important rules of a good researcher: **Do not trust anyone!!** and **Respondents lie!!** ;-) In my opinion, these are also good rules for testing...

Goals I'm working on:
1. **Development of programming skills**. In the near future I would like to develop as an automation tester. Purely manual testing limits the scope of testing.
The Direction: Java (IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, Selenium WebDriver).

2. **Developing skills related to Backend Testing** - REST API, Postman. Fronted testing is not enough.
The Direction: REST API (Postman, Swagger).

3. **Testing mobile and web applications**. The internet is no longer stationary. Movement is an integral part of our lives. Applications and websites - must follow us. Current web testing will be very helpful in achieving this goal.
The Direction: I started a course on creating automated tests for mobile applications at the user interface level. Creating tests using the Java programming language.
